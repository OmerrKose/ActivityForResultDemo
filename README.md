# ActivityForResultDemo
Basic Kotlin application to pass data between activities.
<p>There are 3 activities for the user, main, first, second. From the main activity user can decide which activity to continue with by clicking buttons.
In first activity user is expected to press a "Finish" button to pass on a string variable to the main activity. In second activity user can enter his/her name 
and email address. Entered variables will be displayed in main activity after user clicks on "Submit" button. If no variable is passed by the user an "Error"
message will be displayed in the application.</p>

<p>Code is based on the [The Complete Android 10 & Kotlin Development Masterclass](#https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/learn/lecture/17999171#overview)
